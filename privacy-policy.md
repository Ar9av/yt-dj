# Privacy Policy for YouTube Timestamp DJ

**Last Updated: November 2025**

## Overview
YouTube Timestamp DJ ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect
Our extension collects no personal information whatsoever. We do not:
- Track your browsing habits
- Collect your IP address
- Store any personal data on our servers
- Transmit any data over the internet

## Local Data Storage
The extension stores timestamp data locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data includes:
- Timestamps you set for YouTube videos
- Video IDs to associate timestamps with specific videos

All data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third parties.

## How We Use Information
The locally stored timestamp data is used solely to provide the extension's functionality - allowing you to save and recall timestamps for YouTube videos.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.

## Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted, security risks are minimal. However, you should always keep your Chrome browser and extensions updated for optimal security.

## Your Rights
You can delete all stored data at any time by:
- Clicking "Clear All Timestamps" in the extension popup
- Uninstalling the extension (which removes all stored data)
- Clearing browser data through Chrome settings

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the extension's updated version.
